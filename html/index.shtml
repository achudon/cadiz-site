            <p>The NW CÁDIZ program offers American students the opportunity to live and study in Cádiz, Spain, for one semester
                or a full academic year. Administered by the University of Washington, this study-abroad program operates under a
                formal working agreement with the University of Cádiz. It is the only full-year American study-abroad program located
                in Cádiz. Students live with a private family and attend classes at the University of Cádiz's Facultad de Filosofía y
                Letras. NW CÁDIZ courses are especially designed for the program's students and are taught in Spanish by members of the
                University of Cádiz faculty. </p>

            Cádiz is located on Spain's southern Atlantic coast, midway between Portugal and the Strait of Gibraltar. The city's
            current population is approximately 300,000. Founded by Phoenician traders around 1100 B.C., Cádiz is the oldest
            city in Spain and possibly the oldest in Europe. Because of its antiquity and its strategic geographic situation,
            Cádiz's role in the formation of the Spanish nation has been unsurpassed by that of any other Spanish city. The
            original Phoenician outpost of Gadir would later be colonized by the Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors.
            In 1262, during the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Cádiz was conquered by King Alfonso X. In the
            late 15th and early 16th centuries the city and its port played a central role in Spain's voyages of exploration
            and conquest, including Columbus' second, third, and fourth voyages to America. </p>

        <div id="map"></div>

        <p>
            In 1587, as a prelude to the famous
            defeat of the Spanish Armada at the hands of the English, Cádiz was sacked and burned by Sir Francis Drake. During
            the next two centuries Cádiz continued to bear the brunt of ongoing naval hostilities between Spain and England,
            but it also prospered as Spain's principal port for commerce with the New World and with Europe. This intense
            international commerce brought with it philosophical, artistic, and political currents from other nations,
            endowing Cádiz and its people with the tolerance and hospitality that still characterize them today. </p>

        <p>
            In the
            19th century, with the independence of Spain's American colonies, the city's importance as a shipping center
            declined, but it continued to play a key role in the nation's political life as Spain's principal window to
            Europe and as an oasis of liberal thought throughout that turbulent century. The Gaditanos are intensely proud
            of the fact that Spain's first modern constitution was written and promulgated in Cádiz in 1812. Many special
            events will be held throughout 2011-2012 to celebrate the bicentennial of the Spanish Constitution.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">

        <p>Today's Cádiz is linked to Madrid and Barcelona by commercial air service, and to all of Spain by frequent high-speed
            trains. There is ferry service from Cádiz to the Canary Islands and North Africa. The economy of the city and the
            surrounding region is based on fishing, maritime industries, and the production of Sherry wines. Because of its
            mild climate and brilliant sunshine, the area's spectacular coastline is known as the Costa de la Luz. While
            tourism plays a significant role in the local economy, its cultural impact is minimal in comparison to the
            destructive effect of tourism on Spain's Mediterranean coast.</p>

        <p>The narrow peninsula on which Cádiz is situated is divided by a seventeenth-century fortified rampart, the Puerta de
            Tierra, behind which is located the Casco Antiguo, or old Cádiz. The layout and outward appearance of the old city
            have remained largely unchanged for the past two centuries. This part of the city is characterized by buildings of
            three and four stories, clustered on narrow, teeming streets that open onto gracious plazas or the surrounding sea.
            On the inland side of the rampart is the new Cádiz with its high-rise apartment houses that pose a striking
            architectural contrast to the quaint Casco Antiguo. The coastal periphery of the city is lined with promenades,
            old fortifications, an industrial port, and public beaches, including the longest urban beach in Europe.</p>
            <img src="../img/torretavira.jpg" alt="picture of Torre Tavira in Cádiz by Katrina Peters"/>
        <p>The traditions of Cádiz offer many opportunities for recreation and cultural enrichment outside the classroom.
            Geography and history have endowed Cádiz with close ties to Latin America. One product of this link is the
            Festival de Teatro Hispanoamericano, which takes place in the theatres and plazas of Cádiz each year in October.
            In February, as a prelude to the Lenten season, Cádiz becomes the site of the Iberian Peninsula's most colorful
            and spirited Carnival. University classes are cancelled for a week as the city is transformed into a boisterous
            fantasyland of costumes and revelry. During the week before Easter, Cádiz, like the rest of Spain, celebrates
            Semana Santa with a timeless blend of solemn rituals and festive pageantry. Again, the university closes for a
            week so that students and faculty may fully enjoy this most traditional of Spanish holidays.</p>

        <p>The Bay and Gulf of Cádiz are ringed with places of interest. Chiclana, San Fernando, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, El Puerto
            de Santa María, and Jerez de la Frontera are important centers of the subcultures associated with Flamenco music,
            Sherry wines, and the breeding of Andalusian horses and fighting bulls. The University of Cádiz sponsors frequent
            student excursions to these and other places of interest. North of Cádiz lies Spain's largest national park, Doñana.
            Once a hunting reserve for the royal family, Doñana is now a sanctuary for migratory birds and other wildlife.
            The mountains in the province of Cádiz are famous for their quaint pueblos blancos and are ideal for hiking,
            biking, and camping.</p>

    The University of Cádiz, in existence since 1980, is one of the younger members of Spain's national university system.
The NW CÁDIZ program operates in the university's Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, located on the old city's shoreline
drive, across from an expansive park that opens onto the sea. The Facultad is housed in a recently restored 
eighteenth-century building whose interior is spacious and bathed in light, thanks to a design that features abundant 
use of full-length windows and interior patios adorned with the lush vegetation of the region. Classrooms are equipped 
with modern audiovisual installations. Computer labs are available for student use and open WIFI connection is available
in and near the Facultad and here and there throughout the city. The Casco Antiguo, with its endless recreational 
possibilities, lies just to the inland side of the Facultad. </p>

        <p>
        NW CÁDIZ students will enroll in courses designed especially for the program and taught in Spanish by University
        of Cádiz faculty. Most classes meet three hours per week and carry three semester credits. A typical course load is four
        or five courses per semester, depending on the requirements of the student's home institution. For students whose
        American university operates on the quarter system, credits will be converted to quarter credits by the home institution
        (one semester credit normally equals 1.5 quarter credits).
        </p>
        <p>All courses are graded on a 4 point scale. We will convert
            and assign A, A-, B+ grades for students from other universities at their request. Credit/No Credit is not normally
            an option. The curriculum consists of advanced Spanish grammar and composition (required of all students except those
            exempted by their home university), plus a variety of other courses in the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts
            as they pertain to the Spanish-speaking world. Academic calendars permitting, qualified students may be allowed to
            enroll in regular university courses. Students with an interest in oceanography and marine ecology may wish to
            participate in activities offered by the university's Facultad de Ciencias del Mar.</p>
        <p>During the 2014-2015 academic year the program will offer the following courses:

                an official transcript, all students must pay the non-refundable IP&E fee of $610 by deadline posted in the IP&E Cádiz
                program description. This single (one-time) fee covers one or two semesters of study in Cadiz.

            <p>Students are encouraged to enroll in the program for the full academic year. Enrollment for one semester is

                departure for Spain, an overall GPA of 2.5, and a GPA in Spanish of 3.0. Even though NW CÁDIZ is primarily a program
                for undergraduates, special arrangements can sometimes be made for graduate students to receive credit for work done
                in the program.</p>

            <p>Applications for the fall semester (including letters of recommendation) are due on March 20. Applications for

                permitted and even encouraged. In the event that more qualified students apply for a given semester than can be
                accepted, please keep in mind that among the several criteria used to determine admission, in general, priority is
                given to year-long over single semester students and to more advanced students over those less advanced (in Spanish).

            <p>Current information on the cost of the program is provided in the annual insert and online. NW CÁDIZ
                reserves the right to increase the fee in the event that a fluctuation in the exchange rate makes an adjustment
                necessary. Such adjustments will be made no later than one month prior to the start of each semester. The program fee
                includes full room and board in Cádiz, tuition at the University of Cádiz, textbooks & coursepacks, scheduled program
                activities and excursions, an extra-curricular activity (classical guitar, dance, gym membership, etc.), and transfer
                to and from the Jerez airport on the scheduled arrival and departure days each semester. In addition to the program fee
                and the UW IP&E office concurrent enrollment fee, non-UW students may be required to pay their home institution a fee
                to maintain their student registration while they are studying in Spain. Other expenses not included in the program fee
                are travel to and from Spain, visa and passport expenses, international student ID cards (ISIC card) and personal
                spending money.
            </p>
            <p>University of Washington students who normally receive financial aid may use most forms of financial aid to
                study on the NW CÁDIZ program. Students from other institutions should check with their financial aid office to
                determine applicability of their financial aid to this program. All students who are receiving financial aid should
                determine the number of courses they must carry in order to remain eligible for financial aid.

            <p>Before leaving the country, all students studying abroad through a UW program must take out an insurance policy with On

                but other policies are unlikely to have comparable coverage (particularly medical evacuation and emergency repatriation
                coverage). Cost may increase modestly from year to year, but this policy will be approximately $42/mo. Please wait until

            <p>Students who enroll in the program for both semesters are urged to plan ahead for the Christmas vacation period

                holidays, and that the normal domestic routine is disrupted. A similar situation exists during the Easter vacation
                period (Semana Santa). For students who do stay in Cádiz during vacation periods, the program will assure the

            <p>Students who enroll in the program must be flexible in their eating habits. The customs of southern Spain differ
                greatly from those of the U.S. Breakfast normally consists of bread and coffee, the day's largest meal is eaten around
                3:00 p.m., and dinner is eaten sometime after 9:00 p.m. Food tends to be higher in fat than in the Western U.S., and
                vegetables are eaten less. Strict vegetarians may find it difficult to avoid all animal products; the local diet is
                heavy in pork, and Spain is not a vegetarian-friendly country. Your host family will attempt to provide you with food
                that you find acceptable, but you, in turn, must be prepared to make concessions to the local diet. Most people find the
                cuisine of southern Spain to be exciting and delicious, but to enjoy it you will have to accept new foods and
                eating customs.</p>
