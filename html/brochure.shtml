    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p><span class="tab"></span>The NW CÁDIZ program offers American students the opportunity to live and study in Cádiz, Spain, for one semester
    or a full academic year. Administered by the University of Washington, this study-abroad program operates under a
    formal working agreement with the University of Cádiz. It is the only full-year American study-abroad program located
    in Cádiz. Students live with a private family and attend classes at the University of Cádiz's Facultad de Filosofía y
    Letras. NW CÁDIZ courses are especially designed for the program's students and are taught in Spanish by members of the
    University of Cádiz faculty. </p>

<h2>About Cádiz</h2>
<p>
    <span class="tab"></span>Cádiz is located on Spain's southern Atlantic coast, midway between Portugal and the Strait of Gibraltar. The city's
    current population is approximately 300,000. Founded by Phoenician traders around 1100 B.C., Cádiz is the oldest
    city in Spain and possibly the oldest in Europe. Because of its antiquity and its strategic geographic situation,
    Cádiz's role in the formation of the Spanish nation has been unsurpassed by that of any other Spanish city. The
    original Phoenician outpost of Gadir would later be colonized by the Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors.
    In 1262, during the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Cádiz was conquered by King Alfonso X. In the
    late 15th and early 16th centuries the city and its port played a central role in Spain's voyages of exploration
    and conquest, including Columbus' second, third, and fourth voyages to America. </p>

<p>
    <span class="tab"></span>In 1587, as a prelude to the famous
    defeat of the Spanish Armada at the hands of the English, Cádiz was sacked and burned by Sir Francis Drake. During
    the next two centuries Cádiz continued to bear the brunt of ongoing naval hostilities between Spain and England,
    but it also prospered as Spain's principal port for commerce with the New World and with Europe. This intense
    international commerce brought with it philosophical, artistic, and political currents from other nations,
    endowing Cádiz and its people with the tolerance and hospitality that still characterize them today. </p>

<p>
    <span class="tab"></span>In the
    19th century, with the independence of Spain's American colonies, the city's importance as a shipping center
    declined, but it continued to play a key role in the nation's political life as Spain's principal window to
    Europe and as an oasis of liberal thought throughout that turbulent century. The Gaditanos are intensely proud
    of the fact that Spain's first modern constitution was written and promulgated in Cádiz in 1812. Many special
    events will be held throughout 2011-2012 to celebrate the bicentennial of the Spanish Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="tab"></span>Today's Cádiz is linked to Madrid and Barcelona by commercial air service, and to all of Spain by frequent high-speed
    trains. There is ferry service from Cádiz to the Canary Islands and North Africa. The economy of the city and the
    surrounding region is based on fishing, maritime industries, and the production of Sherry wines. Because of its
    mild climate and brilliant sunshine, the area's spectacular coastline is known as the Costa de la Luz. While
    tourism plays a significant role in the local economy, its cultural impact is minimal in comparison to the
    destructive effect of tourism on Spain's Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p><span class="tab"></span>The narrow peninsula on which Cádiz is situated is divided by a seventeenth-century fortified rampart, the Puerta de
    Tierra, behind which is located the Casco Antiguo, or old Cádiz. The layout and outward appearance of the old city
    have remained largely unchanged for the past two centuries. This part of the city is characterized by buildings of
    three and four stories, clustered on narrow, teeming streets that open onto gracious plazas or the surrounding sea.
    On the inland side of the rampart is the new Cádiz with its high-rise apartment houses that pose a striking
    architectural contrast to the quaint Casco Antiguo. The coastal periphery of the city is lined with promenades,
    old fortifications, an industrial port, and public beaches, including the longest urban beach in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="tab"></span>The traditions of Cádiz offer many opportunities for recreation and cultural enrichment outside the classroom.
    Geography and history have endowed Cádiz with close ties to Latin America. One product of this link is the
    Festival de Teatro Hispanoamericano, which takes place in the theatres and plazas of Cádiz each year in October.
    In February, as a prelude to the Lenten season, Cádiz becomes the site of the Iberian Peninsula's most colorful
    and spirited Carnival. University classes are cancelled for a week as the city is transformed into a boisterous
    fantasyland of costumes and revelry. During the week before Easter, Cádiz, like the rest of Spain, celebrates
    Semana Santa with a timeless blend of solemn rituals and festive pageantry. Again, the university closes for a
    week so that students and faculty may fully enjoy this most traditional of Spanish holidays.</p>

<p><span class="tab"></span>The Bay and Gulf of Cádiz are ringed with places of interest. Chiclana, San Fernando, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, El Puerto
    de Santa María, and Jerez de la Frontera are important centers of the subcultures associated with Flamenco music,
    Sherry wines, and the breeding of Andalusian horses and fighting bulls. The University of Cádiz sponsors frequent
    student excursions to these and other places of interest. North of Cádiz lies Spain's largest national park, Doñana.
    Once a hunting reserve for the royal family, Doñana is now a sanctuary for migratory birds and other wildlife.
    The mountains in the province of Cádiz are famous for their quaint pueblos blancos and are ideal for hiking,
    biking, and camping.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>The University of Cádiz</h2>
<p>
    <span class="tab"></span>The University of Cádiz, in existence since 1980, is one of the younger members of Spain's national university system.
The NW CÁDIZ program operates in the university's Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, located on the old city's shoreline
drive, across from an expansive park that opens onto the sea. The Facultad is housed in a recently restored 
eighteenth-century building whose interior is spacious and bathed in light, thanks to a design that features abundant 
use of full-length windows and interior patios adorned with the lush vegetation of the region. Classrooms are equipped 
with modern audiovisual installations. Computer labs are available for student use and open WIFI connection is available
in and near the Facultad and here and there throughout the city. The Casco Antiguo, with its endless recreational 
possibilities, lies just to the inland side of the Facultad. </p>

<p>The University of Cádiz has a home page on the Web: <a href="http://www.uca.es">http://www.uca.es</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p><span class="tab"></span>
NW CÁDIZ students will enroll in courses designed especially for the program and taught in Spanish by University
of Cádiz faculty. Most classes meet three hours per week and carry three semester credits. A typical course load is four
or five courses per semester, depending on the requirements of the student's home institution. For students whose 
American university operates on the quarter system, credits will be converted to quarter credits by the home institution
(one semester credit normally equals 1.5 quarter credits). All courses are graded on a 4 point scale. We will convert 
and assign A, A-, B+ grades for students from other universities at their request. Credit/No Credit is not normally 
an option. The curriculum consists of advanced Spanish grammar and composition (required of all students except those
exempted by their home university), plus a variety of other courses in the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts
as they pertain to the Spanish-speaking world. Academic calendars permitting, qualified students may be allowed to 
enroll in regular university courses. Students with an interest in oceanography and marine ecology may wish to 
participate in activities offered by the university's Facultad de Ciencias del Mar.
</p>

<p>During the 2014-2015 academic year the program will offer the following courses:

and honors coursework under the supervision of our UCA faculty and the program's Resident Director. Credit for these
projects will vary in accord with the scope and difficulty of each project. Occasionally, qualified students may choose
to undertake practice teaching (of English) at the K-7 or university level.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <h2>Program Administration</h2>
    <p><span class="tab"></span>NW CÁDIZ is operated by the Division of Spanish and Portuguese of the University of Washington. In Cádiz the
        program is directed by a full-time Resident Director well acquainted with the University of Washington degree programs
        and with the University of Cádiz. The Resident Director is assisted by a UW graduate assistant and by a local faculty
        coordinator.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Eligibility and Enrollment</h2>
<p>
<span class="tab"></span>The program will accept applications from students who are currently enrolled in any accredited college or university
in the U.S. All students apply to the program through the UW International Programs & Exchanges (IP&E) Office's NW
Cádiz Program website: NW CÁDIZ IP&E WEBAPP. Students from schools other than the University of Washington must enroll
as non-matriculated students at the University of Washington, but the $200 non-matriculated student fee will be waived
for students participating in the NW Cádiz program. In order to be officially enrolled at UW and to receive grades and
an official transcript, all students must pay the non-refundable IP&E fee of $610 by deadline posted in the IP&E Cádiz
program description. This single (one-time) fee covers one or two semesters of study in Cadiz.
</p>

<p><span class="tab"></span>In addition to the IP&E online NW Cádiz application, students must also fill out and submit hard copy of our
departmental application form and a current unofficial transcript to the NW Cadiz Program office:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="tab"></span>For further information about the program please contact Suzanne Petersen (petersen@uw.edu or at the above address).</p>

    <p><span class="tab"></span>Students are encouraged to enroll in the program for the full academic year. Enrollment for one semester is
also accepted. Minimum requirements for enrollment are two years of college Spanish (or equivalent) completed prior to
departure for Spain, an overall GPA of 2.5, and a GPA in Spanish of 3.0. Even though NW CÁDIZ is primarily a program
for undergraduates, special arrangements can sometimes be made for graduate students to receive credit for work done
in the program.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <h2>Application Deadlines/Guidelines</h2>
    <p><span class="tab"></span>Applications for the fall semester (including letters of recommendation) are due on March 20. Applications for
    spring semester must be received by October 20. A limited number of early admissions will be granted to exceptionally
    qualified applicants before the published application deadline. For this reason, early submission of applications is
    permitted and even encouraged. In the event that more qualified students apply for a given semester than can be
    accepted, please keep in mind that among the several criteria used to determine admission, in general, priority is
    given to year-long over single semester students and to more advanced students over those less advanced (in Spanish).
    </p>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <h2>Program Cost</h2>
    <p><span class="tab"></span>Current information on the cost of the program is provided in the annual insert and online. NW CÁDIZ
    reserves the right to increase the fee in the event that a fluctuation in the exchange rate makes an adjustment
    necessary. Such adjustments will be made no later than one month prior to the start of each semester. The program fee
    includes full room and board in Cádiz, tuition at the University of Cádiz, textbooks & coursepacks, scheduled program
    activities and excursions, an extra-curricular activity (classical guitar, dance, gym membership, etc.), and transfer
    to and from the Jerez airport on the scheduled arrival and departure days each semester. In addition to the program fee
    and the UW IP&E office concurrent enrollment fee, non-UW students may be required to pay their home institution a fee
    to maintain their student registration while they are studying in Spain. Other expenses not included in the program fee
    are travel to and from Spain, visa and passport expenses, international student ID cards (ISIC card) and personal
    spending money.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="row">
        <p><span class="tab"></span>University of Washington students who normally receive financial aid may use most forms of financial aid to
    study on the NW CÁDIZ program. Students from other institutions should check with their financial aid office to
    determine applicability of their financial aid to this program. All students who are receiving financial aid should
    determine the number of courses they must carry in order to remain eligible for financial aid.
        </p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Payment Schedule and Refund Policy</h2>
<p>
    <span class="tab"></span>An application fee of $100, deductible from the total program fee, must accompany the application to the program.
A payment of $1,000 will be due May 1 for fall semester, and November 1 for spring semester. The balance of the program
fee is due August 1 for fall, and December 1 for spring. Checks or money orders only (NOT CASH) are to be made payable
to the University of Washington. We are not equipped to receive payment by credit card, nor can we access funds in
student UW tuition accounts. Personal or certified checks or money orders ONLY. Payments may be delivered in person to
Padelford C-104 on the UW campus or mailed to "NW Cadiz Program": Division of Spanish & Portuguese, Box 354360,
University of Washington, Seattle WA 98195. Make sure student's last name appears on check, "NWCadiz tuition", in memo,
and, if mailing in, include a self-addressed, stamped envelope so that you may be sent a receipt.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<p><span class="tab"></span>All payments will be refunded in full if the student's application is rejected, or if the program is cancelled.
If an applicant is accepted into the program but decides not to participate, all payments except the $100 application
fee will be refunded, provided that written notice of withdrawal from the program is received no later than August 1
for fall or December 1 for spring. Except in cases of demonstrated emergency, there will be no refunds to accepted
applicants who do not give written notice of withdrawal by these dates, or who withdraw after the start of the semester.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Travel Arrangements</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>The cost of travel to and from Spain is not included in the program fee. However, the program will assist
students in making travel arrangements that will enable them to travel to and from Spain in accord with the official
arrival and departure dates for their semester(s) of study. Students are free to make their own travel arangements,
so long as they arrive by the official start date and depart after the last scheduled final exam (for specific dates,
see the online Academic Calendar for the year in question).
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Housing Arrangements in Cádiz</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>Students will normally live in private homes, but it may sometimes be possible to arrange housing in a residence
hall for those who strongly prefer not to live with a local family. We do not presently allow shared apartment living
as a housing option for undergraduates. For the occasional student who is accompanied throughout the semester by a
partner or child, other living arrangements are possible, but it will be the responsibility of the student to make
such arrangements.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Medical Insurance</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>Before leaving the country, all students studying abroad through a UW program must take out an insurance policy with On
Call International for the duration of their study abroad program. We recommend it cover you for the entire extent of
your travels abroad. If you are covered under another policy, you may apply to IPE for a waiver of this requirement,
but other policies are unlikely to have comparable coverage (particularly medical evacuation and emergency repatriation
coverage). Cost may increase modestly from year to year, but this policy will be approximately $42/mo. Please wait until
the UW contract with On Call International is in place for the appropriate academic year before signing up. Typically
that happens in August.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Vacation Periods</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>Students who enroll in the program for both semesters are urged to plan ahead for the Christmas vacation period
and, when possible, to plan not to stay in Cádiz. During Christmas vacation the program's office at the university
closes and all academic activities cease. The Spanish students leave town and residence halls close or curtail their
normal services. Students in private homes may find that their host families have their own travel plans for the
holidays, and that the normal domestic routine is disrupted. A similar situation exists during the Easter vacation
period (Semana Santa). For students who do stay in Cádiz during vacation periods, the program will assure the
availability of basic housing and food. However, these services may be improvised and inconvenient.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Eating in Cádiz</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>Students who enroll in the program must be flexible in their eating habits. The customs of southern Spain differ
greatly from those of the U.S. Breakfast normally consists of bread and coffee, the day's largest meal is eaten around
3:00 p.m., and dinner is eaten sometime after 9:00 p.m. Food tends to be higher in fat than in the Western U.S., and
vegetables are eaten less. Strict vegetarians may find it difficult to avoid all animal products; the local diet is
heavy in pork, and Spain is not a vegetarian-friendly country. Your host family will attempt to provide you with food
that you find acceptable, but you, in turn, must be prepared to make concessions to the local diet. Most people find the
cuisine of southern Spain to be exciting and delicious, but to enjoy it you will have to accept new foods and
eating customs.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p><span class="tab"></span>NW Cádiz will exercise all reasonable care in the operation of its program. However, notice is hereby given that
all arrangements for transportation and other services are made for the program's participants upon the condition that
NW CÁDIZ, its officers, and its sponsoring institutions assume no responsibility or liability for any injury, damage,
loss, accident, delay, or other irregularity occasioned by reason of or defect in any means of transportation or acts
of defaults of any company, agency, or person providing transportation or other services. Information contained in this
brochure was accurate at the time the brochure was printed. NW CÁDIZ is not responsible for changes that occur after the
printing of this brochure. However, the internet version of the brochure will be updated regularly and the program will
do everything possible to assure that its participants are in possession of up-to-date information on the program and
the conditions of its operation prior to enrollment in the program and departure for Spain. NW CÁDIZ reserves the right
to cancel the program at any time and for any reason.</p>
